#### Purpose

### Why?
Learning how to build full-stack single-page apps can be laborious when the example app isn't particularly interesting/engaging, OK is an ultra-simple app that will teach you full-stack test-driven-development using express modules on the backend and basic Js on the front-end (no fancy frameworks).

### What you will find here :-
